# Pulsar Cooperative 

Welcome to Pulsar Cooperative! 

This organization aims to find the perfect balance in community lead development, and maintainership.
While community packages for Pulsar become abondoned, archived, or outdated, it can sometimes be difficult to apply small bug fixes in the future. This could be because the community member that knows the bug fix, is not the same community member that wants to be responsible for maintaining that package in the future.
This is where Pulsar Cooperative steps in. If there is a package that has been neglected, due to archival, or abondonment, Pulsar Cooperative can take the reigns to manage the package in terms of publishing, releasing new versions, and housekeeping tasks on GitHub, meanwhile community members of any kind can step forward and provide the most vital aspect, the actual code and bug fixes! 
This means this packages are 100% community developed, meanwhile nobody has to worry about keeping the package up to date.
