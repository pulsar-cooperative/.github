This folder contains details about the template that should be used for each newly forked Pulsar Package repository.

The files in this folder should be used as a loose to strict structure of new files to add to any given repo, with these files intending to accomplish the following:

* Give proper attribution to the original maintainer of the forked package
* Specify the level of support, and the expected method of interaction with the repository
* The GitHub Action workflows to add to the forked repo to ensure a hands off approach is possible.

With our goals stated, let's get to it, with the first template provided being below:

<!-- Pulsar Cooperative Package Repository Template, place at the top of the orignal README -->

# Pulsar Cooperative

This package was originally created by <ORIGINAL_AUTHORS_NAME> and has now been forked under the [`pulsar-cooperative`](https://github.com/pulsar-cooperative) organization.

By forking this package we hope to allow new maintainers to work on this package as needed, without being limited by its previous [archived/unmaintained] status, helping to ensure this package stays up to date and functional for as long as possible without the huge responsibility implied by forking and maintaining this under a personal account.

Maintenance of this package is, as the name suggests, cooperative, with little oversight or assistance from the core Pulsar team. This means any issues filed should be answered and resolved by fellow members of the community. More details are available on the [`pulsar-cooperative` Contributing Guide](https://github.com/pulsar-cooperative/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks a ton for contributing, and the Pulsar team hopes to see you among the stars!
