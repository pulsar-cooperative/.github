This folder contains details about the template that should be used for each newly forked Pulsar Package repository.

The files in this folder should be used as a loose to strict structure of new files to add to any given repo, with these files intending to accomplish the following:

* Give proper attribution to the original maintainer of the forked package
* Specify the level of support, and the expected method of interaction with the repository
* The GitHub Action workflows to add to the forked repo to ensure a hands off approach is possible.

With our goals stated, let's get to it, with the first template provided being below:

<!-- Pulsar Cooperative Package Repository Template, place underneath the first h1 heading in the original readme -->

> [!NOTE]
> This package was originally created by <ORIGINAL_AUTHORS_NAME> and has now been forked under the [`pulsar-cooperative`](https://github.com/pulsar-cooperative) organization.
> By forking this package we hope to allow new maintainers to work on this package as needed, without being limited by its previous [archived/unmaintained] status, helping to ensure this package stays up to date and functional for as long as possible without the huge responsibility implied by forking and maintaining this under a personal account.

> For more info on the Pulsar Cooperative initiative please read [the documentation](https://github.com/pulsar-cooperative/.github/blob/main/README.md).
