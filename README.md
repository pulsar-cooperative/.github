## Requesting new Packages be added to the Pulsar Cooperative Organization

If you'd like a new package to be added to this organization, there are some requirements to consider:

A package being included into this org can **only** occur if it's deemed that this is the only or best way for that package to maintained in the future. This does mean that maintaining the package on the original repository is not possible. How is this determined?

* The repository is archived. Once archived it's impossible for new bug fixes to occur.
* The repository maintainer has announced they are no longer supporting or maintaining the package.
* The repository has been abandoned. This one admittedly is the hardest to prove. Generally this would mean years of zero updates, but a case can be made if it has not been as long.

Once you'd like to see a new package added to this org, feel free to open up an issue against this repository for consideration.
